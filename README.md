# My custom Marp themes

[Marp](https://marp.app/) is used to create presentations in Markdown. In this repository, you may find simple CSS themes that I have created. Namely:

## `beam`

- inspired by / based on [LaTeX's beamer class](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer)

- download the [Computer Modern Unicode font family](https://ctan.org/pkg/cm-unicode?lang=en) for best results
- follow the [tutorial](how-to/beam_custom.md) to change the primary colors
- more screenshots on the [community themes website](https://rnd195.github.io/marp-community-themes/theme/beam.html)

*Download the CSS file:*

# Installation

Assuming you're using the VSCode Marp extensionâ€¦

1. Open Settings in VSCode (`Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for "Marp: Themes" or "markdown.marp.themes"
3. Add either a local (on your computer) or a remote path to the CSS file
   - Please, refer to [this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17341122/link-and-execute-external-javascript-file-hosted-on-github/) about linking to files on GitHub
4. Enable the theme in the front-matter of the Markdown document, i.e., write the following at the very beginning of the Markdown document:

```
---
marp: true
theme: theme_name
---
```

5. Try restaring VSCode if it doesn't work right away

For additional settings (such as `size` or `paginate`), follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/blob/main/website/docs/guide/directives.md).
