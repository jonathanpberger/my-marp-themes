# My custom Marp themes

[Marp](https://marp.app/) is used to create presentations in Markdown. In this repository, you may find simple CSS themes that I have created. Namely:

## `beam`

- inspired by / based on [LaTeX's beamer class](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer)

- download the [Computer Modern Unicode font family](https://ctan.org/pkg/cm-unicode?lang=en) for best results
- follow the [tutorial](how-to/beam_custom.md) to change the primary colors
- more screenshots on the [community themes website](https://rnd195.github.io/marp-community-themes/theme/beam.html)

*Download the CSS file:*

```
https://rnd195.github.io/my-marp-themes/beam.css
```

## `border`

- based on the `default` Marp theme

- note that the theme imports a font from Google Fonts (see *Privacy notice* below)

*Download the CSS file:*

# Installation

Assuming you're using the VSCode Marp extensionâ€¦

1. Open Settings in VSCode (`Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for "Marp: Themes" or "markdown.marp.themes"
3. Add either a local (on your computer) or a remote path to the CSS file
   - *Links*: please, consider forking the repository and hosting the CSS files using, for example, GitHub Pages ([related Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52921967)) instead of linking to the raw file on GitHub (refer to [GitHub's blogpost](https://github.blog/2013-04-24-heads-up-nosniff-header-support-coming-to-chrome-and-firefox/) for more info)
4. Enable the theme in the front-matter of the Markdown document, i.e., write the following at the very beginning of the Markdown document:

```
---
marp: true
theme: theme_name
---
```

5. Try restaring VSCode if it doesn't work right away

For additional settings (such as `size` or `paginate`), follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/blob/main/website/docs/guide/directives.md).

# Attribution

The `beam`, `border`, `graph_paper`, and `gradient` themes are based on the `default` Marp themes made by [yhatt](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/tree/main/themes). The `border` and `gradient` themes import the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) font by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/). The `graph_paper` theme imports the [Work Sans](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans) font by [Wei Huang](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang).

# Privacy notice

Please, be aware that by using some of the CSS themes (namely `border`, `gradient`, and `graph_paper`) you import fonts from the Google Fonts service. Please, refer to their [Privacy FAQ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy) for more information about using their service.

The CSS files are also hosted on the GitHub Pages site of this repository (deployed from the `live` branch). The site is automatically built after each commit.
